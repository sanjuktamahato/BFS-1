# BFS-1
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores nodes level by level, starting from a source node. It uses a queue to visit all neighbors before moving to the next level. BFS is used for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs and in scenarios like peer-to-peer networks or social networks.
